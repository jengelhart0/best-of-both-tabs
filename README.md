Best of Both Tabs is a chrome extension that provides you with a side-by-side view of the desktop and mobile web version of a website.

### Installation

1. Download and unzip.
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Check the box "Developer mode" on the upper right.
4. Click the button "Load unpacked extension..." and select the best-of-both-tabs folder.
5. You will see our icon to the right of the search bar.

### Getting Started

After installing, click the icon to start a mirrored session. Your current window will automatically be resized, and a new window will be opened on the right side of your screen.
The window on the left will show the desktop version of the website, and the window on the right will show the mobile web version of the website.
From here on, all actions you take in either window will be replicated in the other. Click on a link, and the mirrored window will navigate to the same URL. Scroll down the page, and the mirrored window will scroll proportionally.
Tabs are also mirrored between the windows. Open a new tab, and the mirrored window will open a new tab too. Each action you take in a tab will also take place in the corresponding tab in the mirrored window.


### Options

To access the options, right click our icon and hit "options".

- Device: Best of Both Tabs comes with a few preset devices. You can add your own device by specifying a device name, user agent, width, and height. You can find the user agent for any device by searching for it. A user agent will look something like this: <pre>Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 10_2_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/602.4.6 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0 Mobile/14D27 Safari/602.1</pre>
- Scroll lock:
    - When scroll lock is on, scrolling will be mirrored between tabs. You can still move up and down a page without it being mirrored by using the up and down arrows or spacebar.
- Start session in:
    - When "same window" is selected, your session will begin with the current URL in the same desktop window, and a new mobile window.
    - When "new window" is selected,  your Best of Both Tabs session will begin with the current URL in a new desktop window and a new mobile window. 
- Text Highlighting (Beta):
    - When text highlighting is on, highlighting text in a tab will highlight the same text, if present, in the mirrored tab. If there are multiple matches in the mirrored tab, you can scroll through the matches by hitting the left and right arrow. Un-highlight text in the original window to remove the highlighting.
